// `MobileEntitlementsStore.swift` is compiled directly into this logic-test
// target (see project.yml), so the ids under test are the exact same source of
// truth the app ships — no `@testable import` of the full iOS app required.

/// Guards against the "empty paywall" failure mode: if any id in
/// `MobileEntitlementsStore.configuredProductIds` is not actually a sellable
/// product, `Product.products(for:)` returns fewer products and the paywall
/// renders with no buy button — silently shipping a $0 release.
///
/// This test resolves every configured id against `Products.storekit`, which
/// must mirror what is registered in App Store Connect. If you add a product id
/// to the app (e.g. a Pro Annual subscription), add it to `Products.storekit`
/// and App Store Connect too, or this test fails first.
